Almost all online services use a recommendation system in one way or other. Even though the field is widely explored, it still remains a challenging problem and a lot of research is still going on. We want to explore various advanced ML models by implementing those for a movie recommendation system. We believe working on this problem will give us a better understanding of ML concepts and give us a first hand experience of designing and debugging ML systems. The model will be trained using available ratngs and at testing time, it will predict ratings for a given (user,movie) pair.
