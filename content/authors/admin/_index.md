I am an ardent researcher interested in exploring and developing machine learning for computer vision, computational sustainability, and natural language understanding.

I am currently working on utilizing machine learning to jointly understand the semantics of programming languages and natural languages, making it easy to comprehend code. I am also working on recommending microservice partitions for a given piece of code for application modernization. 

Previously I have worked on using machine learning to capture facial features to generate images of family members. I have also developed an open-source toolkit for freely experimenting and interacting with Generative Adversarial Networks in a code-less fashion.
